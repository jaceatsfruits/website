  <h2>artist statement (Dec 07 2024)</h2>
  <p>Whenever there’s a political <span style="color:#dc2d9f;">turmoil</span> breaking out somewhere else on the <span style="color:#3e3709;">map</span>, seeing people put it on their Instagram stories with the red heartbreak emoji, he feels an uncontrollable joy, followed by an almost tragic sense of absurd <span style="color:#082430;">relief</span>. It's not cynicism, he insists. It's sorrow. Immense and honest. Maybe even resilient.</p>
  <p>For them, bad news always comes from <span style="color:#868de5;">afar</span>. One more calamity, he thinks, and the distance between <span style="color:#eda5d3;">them</span> and him might grow smaller. The barriers thinner. But the actual <span style="color:#cbb4b4;">distance</span>—between people and people—is immutable.</p>
  <p>Years ago, on R’s Twitter homepage, there was a photo: Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin running toward the camera, hands clasped. His idealized <span style="color:#f1e435;">image</span> of being in <span style="color:#ea0206;">love</span>.</p>
  <p>He drinks <i>Fiji</i> water. Thinks <span style="color:#2c021d;">Kanye West</span> is phenomenal. Reaches into the pocket of his <span style="color:rgba(2,16,106,0.85);">Belgian designer</span> coat. Finds a cigarette. Plays a <span style="color:#bb4f95;">post-Soviet</span> rock album.</p>
  <p>The sky is clear. Not freezing. Frost on car windows. He thinks it'll all melt—<span style="color:#073247;">traceless</span>—within the hour. J’s demo is still playing. It was just a gesture. A shared <span style="color:#fef9dd;">delusion</span>.</p>
  <p>“I want to <span style="color:#f6dfee;">write</span> like Ingeborg Bachmann one day,” he thinks—until J's voice interrupts: soft, like a sweet AI named <span style="color:#f552bc;">Emily</span>. Downloadable only with a <span style="color:#1cf999;">paid subscription</span>.</p>
  <p>He imagines becoming a novelist over the next <span style="color:#e5dde3;">thirty years</span>. Remembers a lecture from <a href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank">Orhan Pamuk</a>: it takes 100 years for a village to become a city in New York. 50 in Istanbul. 20 in Shanghai.</p>
  <p>Yesterday, he returned to Shanghai via <i>Mapillary</i>. Google Street View doesn’t work. He wandered <span style="color:#ff004c;">virtual</span> streets, jumping seasons with <span style="color:#f28656;">clicks</span>. Someone once asked him to describe Shanghai. They expected a village. It used to be true. But not anymore. Not with a Balenciaga <span style="color:#f6f0f4;">billboard</span>.</p>
  <p>Still, they call it <i>the French Concession</i>. A <span style="color:#a8efb3;">symbol</span> of superior taste. A fantasy everyone fills with their own <i>flâneur</i>. Bourgeois classiness in a communist country. Colonial <span style="color:#deee45;">bittersweet</span>, he thinks. They’ll never get it.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><i>Everything is accelerating.</i><br>
  Everything becomes <a href="https://freight.cargo.site/t/original/i/Z2101550576269921245622613759628/clayre-eef-deurknop-o-4-cm-blauw-wit.jpg" target="_blank">flatter</a>.<br>
  He could not sleep.<br>
  Gentrification is underrated, he thinks.</p>
