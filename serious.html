  <p>Jacqueline (b. 2000, Beijing) is a multimedia poet shaped by migratory dissonance—raised across China, Canada, Singapore, and the U.S., now based in the Netherlands. Her practice draws from the logic of collage, code, and emotional debris, entangling disparate materials to simulate the texture of contemporary vertigo.</p>
  <p>She crafts a language from the ruins of failed universal modernity, examining how memory becomes commodified, how affect is mediated through digital interfaces, and how identity performs labour even in private. Her work gestures toward a courageous type of sadness—a melancholia both personal and systemic, rendered by cultural overproduction, semantic exhaustion, and the spectral inertia of geopolitical histories.</p>
  <p>She treats CGI as a philosophical instrument, snapshot and screenshot as serious photography, staging and lighting as surrealist painting aware of its medium. Her project-based work salvages and reconfigures fragmented presences—digital, physical or symbolic—and ritualizes them through writing, video, installation, and occasionally through performance or a URL.</p>
